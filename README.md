# Gas Density and Mass Analysis in TNG Simulations

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing and modeling gas density profiles and mass distributions in galaxy clusters from the TNG100 and TNG300 simulations. The scripts cover tasks ranging from data extraction and statistical analysis to parameter exploration and symbolic regression.

---

The scripts in this repository perform the following tasks:
- Extract and normalize gas density profiles of galaxy clusters.
- Compute median density profiles and compare individual clusters.
- Calculate mass integrals and assess parameter effects on density profiles.
- Use symbolic regression via PySR to model density behaviors with interpretable equations.
